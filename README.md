# Cursor Trial Reset Tool

A utility tool that helps manage Cursor editor's device identification system by resetting stored device IDs. This can help users to resolve issues related to account restrictions when switching between accounts or during trial periods.

## Download Compatible Version
**Cursor v0.44.11**
- Windows: [Official](https://downloader.cursor.sh/builds/250103fqxdt5u9z/windows/nsis/x64) | [Mirror](https://download.todesktop.com/230313mzl4w4u92/Cursor%20Setup%200.44.11%20-%20Build%20250103fqxdt5u9z-x64.exe)
- Mac: [Apple Silicon](https://dl.todesktop.com/230313mzl4w4u92/versions/0.44.11/mac/zip/arm64)

## Disable Auto-Update Feature
> To prevent Cursor from automatically updating to unsupported new versions, you can block the update server.

1. Open Hosts file:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

2. Add the following lines to the file and save:
```
# block cursor autoupdate
127.0.0.1 download.todesktop.com
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** After disabling the autoupdates, you can execute the script to reset the device ID.

## How It Works

The tool generates a new device identifier, which allows Cursor to recognize your system as a new device.

## Key Features

- ✨ Automatic random device ID generation
- 🔄 Automatic backup of original configuration
- 📦 Zero dependencies - runs with built-in Python only.

## Installation & Usage

```bash
curl -sL dub.sh/cursorreset | python3
```

> [dub.sh/cursorreset](https://dub.sh/cursorreset) is a shortcut for downloading the script file [`reset.py`](./reset.py) from this repository.

You can also download the script file [`reset.py`](./reset.py) from this repository, make changes to it and run it manually.

```bash
python3 reset.py
```

This will generate a new random device ID.

❗️❗️❗️ **Important**: You need to log out and completely close Cursor before running the script. If Cursor is still running in the background, it may revert back to the previous device ID, undoing the reset.

## Configuration Location

You can also manually edit the configuration file to set a specific device ID. The default configuration file for each operating system is located at:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\storage.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/storage.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/storage.json`
